# Flatdango
This is an application that allows a user to purchase tickets for the movies.

# Setup
The application has six files. index.html containig all the html, a stylesheet for styling the document, index.js file that will enable interactivity, a licence and a readme file.

# Expected Deliverables
As a user, I can:

1. See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. 
   

2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page when the page loads.
   

3. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
   see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not
   be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets
   available).
